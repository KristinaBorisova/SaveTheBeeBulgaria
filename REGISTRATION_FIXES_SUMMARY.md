## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project HoneyWebPlatform.Web
   ```

2. **Navigate to registration page**:
   - Go to `/User/Register`
   - Verify the form no longer has profile picture upload field

3. **Test Valid Registration**:
   - Fill in all required fields (Email, Password, Confirm Password, First Name, Last Name)
   - Submit the form
   - Verify user is created and signed in
   - Check logs for detailed registration process

4. **Test Validation Scenarios**:
   - **Empty fields**: Leave required fields empty and verify error messages
   - **Invalid email**: Enter invalid email format
   - **Short password**: Enter password less than 6 characters
   - **Password mismatch**: Enter different passwords in password and confirm password fields
   - **Duplicate email**: Try to register with an existing email

5. **Check Logs**:
   - Monitor application logs for detailed registration process information
   - Verify all steps are logged correctly
   - Check error logs for failed registration attempts
