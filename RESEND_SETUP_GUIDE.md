# 🍯 Resend Email Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
I've successfully integrated [Resend](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-dotnet) for reliable email sending in your order system. This replaces the previous SMTP setup with a more robust solution.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Resend Package Installation**
- Added `Resend` NuGet package to `HoneyWebPlatform.Web.csproj`
- Version: 1.0.0

### 2. **Dependency Injection Configuration**
- Configured Resend in `Program.cs` with proper DI setup
- Added HTTP client for Resend API calls
- Configured API token from environment variables or appsettings

### 3. **New Email Service**
- Created `ResendOrderEmailService.cs` with beautiful HTML email templates
- Implements the same `IOrderEmailService` interface
- Sends emails to both customers and admin

### 4. **Email Templates**
- **Customer Confirmation**: Beautiful HTML template with order details
- **Admin Notification**: Urgent-style notification for new orders
- **Status Updates**: Professional status change notifications

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Your Resend API Key
1. Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

### Step 2: Configure API Key

#### Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended for Railway)
```bash
# In Railway Dashboard → Variables
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
```

#### Option B: appsettings.json (For local development)
```json
{
  "Resend": {
    "ApiKey": "re_your_api_key_here"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Verify Domain (Important!)
1. Go to [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Add your domain: `savethebeebulgaria.com`
3. Verify domain ownership
4. Update the "From" address in emails

## 📧 Email Features

### Customer Order Confirmation
- **From**: `Save The Bee Bulgaria <noreply@savethebeebulgaria.com>`
- **To**: Customer's email
- **Content**: Order details, total price, contact info
- **Design**: Professional HTML with your brand colors

### Admin Order Notification
- **From**: `Save The Bee Bulgaria <noreply@savethebeebulgaria.com>`
- **To**: `savethebeebulgaria@gmail.com`
- **Content**: Urgent notification with order details
- **Design**: Red-themed urgent notification

### Order Status Updates
- **From**: `Save The Bee Bulgaria <noreply@savethebeebulgaria.com>`
- **To**: Customer's email
- **Content**: Status change notifications
- **Design**: Professional status update template

## 🚀 Testing the Integration

### 1. Run Database Setup
```sql
-- Run this in Railway Database
sql_scripts/setup_complete_order_system.sql
```

### 2. Test Order Form
1. Go to your homepage
2. Fill out the order form
3. Submit the order
4. Check both email addresses for notifications

### 3. Check Logs
Look for these debug messages in Railway logs:
```
DEBUG: Order confirmation email sent successfully to customer@example.com
DEBUG: Admin order notification sent successfully
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "API Key Not Found"
- **Solution**: Ensure `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable is set in Railway
- **Check**: Railway Dashboard → Variables → Add `RESEND_API_KEY`

#### 2. "Domain Not Verified"
- **Solution**: Verify your domain in Resend Dashboard
- **Temporary Fix**: Use `onboarding@resend.dev` as sender (for testing only)

#### 3. "Email Not Sending"
- **Check**: Railway logs for specific error messages
- **Verify**: API key is correct and has proper permissions

### Debug Commands
```sql
-- Check if order was created
SELECT * FROM "Orders" ORDER BY "CreatedOn" DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check order items
SELECT * FROM "OrderItems" ORDER BY "Id" DESC LIMIT 5;
```
